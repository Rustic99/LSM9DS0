### Hacking on Sparkfun 9dof block for Edison (LSM9DS0)

Some initial code to get data out of the Sparkfun 9 Degrees of Freedom
Block for Intel Edison. The block contains a LSM9DS0 9DOF IMU with a
3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope, and a 3-axis magnetometer.

The code is currently just hacks, might grow into a library. Lots of
inspiration has been taken from the
[LSM9DS0_Breakout](https://github.com/sparkfun/LSM9DS0_Breakout)
project. 

Feel free to use this code in any way you want.
